This includes all of the bug fixes and reports and lots of helpful information. If you run into trouble without this you are SOL. I learned the hard way to stick with the supported releases rather than go off trying to figure it out. I spent a week with Ubuntu and then another few days with Oracle Enterprise Linux 8 latest and greatest (which is not supported for Oracle 19c!!!). Just don’t do it. Frustration will be immense if you cannot get to the support documentation. [Note: You can get the database to install, but grid is another matter].<p>This is our Home Theatre PC. Other than acting as a file server, the main usage it gets is Netflix via a web browser. That will work just find under Linux too, so I’m hopeful wife won’t mind which OS is running most of the time. That is the goal.<h1 id="credits">Credits</h1><p>I found all sorts of references using google searches and learned from them (as well as having been doing similar stuff for 35 years including sysadmin a very long time ago). Unfortunately, I did not save links except in a few cases where I included them. Rest assured though that if you google any of these subjects you will hit the same resources that I worked my way through. I wish I had done a better job with it. Nobody can know all this stuff. I mostly just fumbled my way through.<h1 id="hardware">Hardware</h1><ul><li>Intel NUC 7i5BNH with 512GB SSD with windows 10 installed.<li>LaCie d2 Professional SCSI Disk Device 4TB Thunderbolt USB drive ($200!!!!). It isn’t SSD but it is an enterprise level 4TB disk drive that is plenty fast through the USB-C Thunderbolt interface. I’ll be installing Oracle Linux and Oracle database on this drive.<li>“My Book” 3TB USB drive for windows public smb share for photos. This drive is shared by the windows boot as our “G” drive and I’ll be making the Linux boot share it the same way. The clients use the IP address to mount it and don’t care whether the machine is booted as Windows or Linux.<li>Although you can shrink the space on main windows drive and install Linux, I’m installing everything on the 4TB Lacie Thunderbolt disk. I’m leaving the main windows drive completely alone, though the boot loader may get touched along the way. My expectation is I can recover completely to the windows normal boot if needed.</ul><h1 id="partitioning-the-drive">Partitioning the Drive</h1><p>Although you can let the Oracle Linux installer do this, it doesn’t behave the way I want. I want a raw partition to use with ASM for the Oracle data disks. I couldn’t figure out how to make the installer create that partition without putting a file system on it, so I would have to come back and do it later anyway. I found it easier just to use the Windows “Disk Management” tool to do it (or you can boot a gparted image from USB, but I didn’t find it necessary). On windows hit Start then type in “Disk Management”. I decided on the following:<ul><li>200 MB (198) partition for EFI /boot/efi<li>1 GB partition for /boot<li>552 GB partition for Volume Manager</ul><p>I wanted to leave room for the volume manager partition to grow so I created a partition with 1124.81 GB (the remainder) that I later removed leaving a gap. I realize the volume manager probably could have dealt with it just fine with it split across the disk, but I haven’t explored it yet.<p>I was going to create a 2TB partition for ASM, but ran into a snag (it was slightly over). The documentation says the 2TB limitation is fixed after Oracle 11, but it is apparently still a problem. Breaking it into two 1TB partitions works fine and also gives me more chance to play with ASM. So, two 1024 GB (1048576 MB) partitions after the gap to use with ASM.<p>After creating the two partitions for ASM, I deleted the place holder for the volume manager partition growth (1124.81 GB now unallocated). The resulting allocation looks like this (DISK 2 which is the Lacie drive):<p><img src="/images/050920_0017_installorac1.png" alt="" /><h1 id="bios-setup">BIOS Setup</h1><p>While in Windows you may want to Turn off Fast Startup. If you google it you will find plenty of entries on how to do it. I don’t think it actually matters for this and it might get turned back on by windows update, but there are reports of it interfering with dual boot. On my machine I have to press F2 during startup during a very limited period to get to the bios setup. While there I can extend that time so it isn’t so hard to catch it. Now I don’t remember where exactly I found that on the NUC bios, but it waits 5 or 10 seconds for keyboard interrupt now on a power cycle. Turn off Fast Boot and make sure Secure boot is off. Make sure boot from USB is turned on. Here are some pictures of my bios screen. Not sure how useful they will be, but can’t hurt:<p><img src="/images/050920_0017_installorac2.jpg" alt="" /><p><img src="/images/050920_0017_installorac3.jpg" alt="" /><h1 id="download-the-oracle-linux-distribution">Download the Oracle Linux Distribution</h1><p>I learned the hard way that the latest and greatest distribution (OL 8) is not supported for the Oracle database 19c!!!!!!! Go to the Oracle database documentation to find a table with supported Linux releases. At this time, it is OEL 7.4 with Unbreakable Kernel 5 (which is included by default). But I found out that when you auto update 7.4, you wind up with 7.8. I hope it will work because 7.4 unbreakable linux kernel did not support my network card. In any case I’m going to try 7.8<p>Go to the Oracle.com website and fumble around until you get to the dropdown menu that has On Premise Products/Software. Pick Oracle Linux. From there you can get to Download Oracle Linux which takes you to edelivery.oracle.com. From there you have to create an account or sign in. You do not need a support contract for this.<p>Search for Oracle Linux. Choose DLP: Oracle Linux 7.8. I know you want that tasty looking 8. Don’t do it. 7.8 is last supported release for the database. Add it to your cart and then go to Checkout on top right.<p>Pick x86 64bit for Platforms/Languages. Don’t freak out at the 14.0 GB, we will trim it down on the next step. Hit continue. Agree to the license. Get rid of the feedback popup. Uncheck everything by unchecking top level. Then go back and pick:<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>V995537-01.iso Oracle Linux Release 7 Update 8 for x86 (64 bit), 4.5 GB

Just download it to the same place as your iso file. You can use that to create the bootable USB.<p>You can find plenty of instructions on the web about how to do that.

You can do it here too. There are plenty of resources you can find about using the installer to do it. Here I’m just assigning the mount points to each partition and to the LVM.<p><img src="/images/050920_0031_installorac5.jpg" alt="" /><p>Note that the /boot/efi partition is standard type EFI format, and /boot is standard type XFS format.<p>Swap is, well, swap format but is on the LVM partition. I made it twice the size of my 8GB of memory. Seems to be debatable how big it should be but 16GB is trivial.<p>The rest go on the LVM partition along with swap and are XFS. I probably overallocated / at 30GB, but I’m putting the /u01 directory there for the Oracle binaries and anything else I install. I’m slightly paranoid about running out of root space from past experience. Your mileage may vary. /home is 500GB because I have it available and sometimes you just need somewhere to put stuff.<p><img src="/images/050920_0031_installorac6.jpg" alt="" /><p><img src="/images/050920_0031_installorac7.jpg" alt="" /><p><img src="/images/050920_0031_installorac8.jpg" alt="" /><p><img src="/images/050920_0031_installorac9.jpg" alt="" /><p><img src="/images/050920_0031_installorac10.jpg" alt="" /><h1 id="finish-the-install">Finish the Install</h1><p>I gave myself an administrator account I can “sudo” from.<p><img src="/images/050920_0031_installorac11.jpg" alt="" /><p>Then let the install rip.<p>When it finishes and wants to reboot, select that and give it a moment to shut down before pulling the USB stick. If you do it too soon, the shutdown hangs. If you it too late, it comes up on the installer boot image again. Either way just turn the machine off at that point. Pull the USB and it should boot to “grub” which will have the Unbreakable Linux kernel first in the boot list, with the RHL kernel next, a recovery image, and then the Windows image. You can rearrange the order later with “grubby” or directly in the grub config file. There are plenty of resources about that.<p>Remember the way I’ve done this, if I pull the plug out on the Lacie driver, the original boot loader on the internal drive should be picked up. This is as safe as it can be as long as I don’t ever do anything to that original internal Windows drive.<p>I booted from the unbreakable linux kernel and came up in gnome desktop, logged in as myself, then went to the Applications menu on the top left to get a gnonme-terminal and did:<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo su -

Wish that had been mentioned in the documentation (or if it was, that I had noticed it). I proceeded with the “udev” rule to change the ownership of the device files as mentioned above. You should have already done that. At that point the /dev/sda[45] files were changed to grid:oinstall which takes care of it.<p>Pressed continue and it finished. Yeaaaaaa!<p><img src="/images/050920_0058_installorac16.png" alt="" /><h1 id="testing-grid-installation">Testing Grid Installation</h1><p>The next section in the install document is <em>Testing the Oracle Automatic Storage Management Installation</em>. I presume the sid I want is +ASM. When I look in the grid home dbs directory I see dbs/init.ora with a db_name=’ORCL’, but in the dbs directory I see some files with ‘+ASM’ in the name.
